SQL (structured query language) -- A language used to interact with databases. It allows for data manipulation and retrieval.
    Database: A collection of related data organized for easy access, management, and updating.
    Table: The fundamental structure in SQL to store data in rows and columns.

Data Types
SQL supports various data types for columns in tables, including:

    INT: Stores integers.
    VARCHAR(n): Stores variable-length strings, with a max length of n.
    CHAR(n): Stores fixed-length strings.
    DATE: Stores date values.
    FLOAT/DOUBLE: Stores decimal numbers.
    BOOLEAN: Stores TRUE or FALSE values.

SQL Commands:
SQL commands are broadly divided into four main categories:
    DDL(Data Defenition Language): These commands define and manage table structures.
    -->  CREATE (Creates a new table or database.)
        CREATE TABLE Employees (
        ID INT,
        Name VARCHAR(50),
        Age INT,
        Salary FLOAT
        );
    --> ALTER (Modifies an existing table by adding, deleting, or modifying columns.)
        ALTER TABLE Employees ADD Department VARCHAR(50);
        ALTER TABLE Employees DROP COLUMN Age;

    --> DROP (Deletes a table or database.)
        DROP TABLE Employees;
        DROP DATABASE CompanyDB;

    --> TRUNCATE (Removes all records from a table, keeping the table structure intact.)
        TRUNCATE TABLE Employees;
    
    DML(Data manipulation Language) : these commands deal with data manipulation within tables.
    --> INSERT: Adds new records to a table.
        INSERT INTO Employees (ID, Name, Age, Salary) VALUES (1, 'Alice', 30, 50000);

    --> UPDATE: Modifies existing records in a table.
        UPDATE Employees SET Salary = 55000 WHERE ID = 1;

    --> DELETE: Deletes records from a table.
        DELETE FROM Employees WHERE Age < 25;

    Data Query Language (DQL): The primary command in DQL is SELECT, used to query data from the database.
    --> SELECT: Retrieves data from one or more tables.
        SELECT * FROM Employees;
        SELECT Name, Salary FROM Employees WHERE Age > 25;
    --> Clauses with SELECT:

        WHERE: Filters records based on conditions.
        ORDER BY: Sorts results by columns.
        GROUP BY: Groups results by one or more columns.
        HAVING: Filters groups based on conditions (used with GROUP BY)    

        SELECT Department, AVG(Salary) 
        FROM Employees 
        GROUP BY Department 
        HAVING AVG(Salary) > 30000;

    Data Control Language (DCL): DCL commands are used to control access to data in a database.
    --> GRANT: Gives users access privileges.
        GRANT SELECT, INSERT ON Employees TO 'username';

    --> REVOKE: Removes access privileges from users.
        REVOKE INSERT ON Employees FROM 'username';
